            The CSS Profile, administered and maintained by the College Board,
            the same group that develops the SAT, opens the door to nonfederal
            scholarships and other kinds of institutional aid.

            Most students complete the application in their senior year of high
            school starting on October 1. Schools may have different deadlines -
            be sure to check with each school you are applying to.

            Some colleges require both of your biological parents—your custodial
            parent and your noncustodial parent—to complete separate
            applications.

            You'll need your most recently completed tax returns, W-2 forms and
            other records of current year income, records of untaxed income and
            benefits, assets, and bank statements.

            The CSS Profile form asks for more detailed information about a
            family’s finances. Assets that were not included in the FAFSA, will
            be asked about on the CSS Profile.
          </li>
          <li>
            For some families, completing the CSS Profile results in
            institutional scholarships and a lower net price, which refers to
            what the student actually pays to go to a particular college.
          </li>
          <li>
            The need-based grant aid available from most private universities is
            significantly higher than what they could qualify for through the
            FAFSA.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some colleges and universities require families to submit the
            Profile every year. Other schools only require the application for
            the student's freshman year. Check with each college or university
            for requirements.
